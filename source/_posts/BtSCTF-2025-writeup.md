This is my writeup for Break the Syntax 2025 ! I got almost all the forensics challs, except for the last one (cmon i was so close üò≠)

It was overall very stego oriented and guessy challs, but I had fun exploring new type of stuff.

## Forensics

### Monkey see

So there's some USB packets given, upon a lil research on this, u can find some helpful stuff like [usb HID](https://wiki.osdev.org/USB_Human_Interface_Devices) and also this super good writeup [kaizen 2018 writeup](https://abawazeeer.medium.com/kaizen-ctf-2018-reverse-engineer-usb-keystrok-from-pcap-file-2412351679f4) 

I figured out that the leftover capture data is what we need to look into, extract the information bits and transform it into readable format.

```bash
tshark -r monkey-see.pcapng -Tfields -Eseparator=, -e usb.capdata -Y 'usb.transfer_type == 0x01 && usb.dst == "host" && !(usb.capdata == 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00)' | sed 's/://g' > usb.capdata
```

with some headscratching and tries, this is the one liner I used to extract the usb capture data which looks like this

now, as I mentioned the 2 links above, i made a small script for this

{% folding cyan::Script: %}
```py
KEY_CODES = {
    0x04: ['a', 'A'], 0x05: ['b', 'B'], 0x06: ['c', 'C'], 0x07: ['d', 'D'],
    0x08: ['e', 'E'], 0x09: ['f', 'F'], 0x0A: ['g', 'G'], 0x0B: ['h', 'H'],

    0x14: ['q', 'Q'], 0x15: ['r', 'R'], 0x16: ['s', 'S'], 0x17: ['t', 'T'],

    0x37: ['.', '>'], 0x38: ['/', '?'], 0x39: ['[CAPSLOCK]', '[CAPSLOCK]']
}

def decode_usb_file(filepath):
    result = []
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            data = line.strip()
            if len(data) < 8:
                continue

            modifier = int(data[0:2], 16)
            shift = int(data[2:4], 16) == 0x02
            keycode = int(data[6:8], 16)

            if keycode == 0:
                continue

            char_pair = KEY_CODES.get(keycode)
            if char_pair:
                result.append(char_pair[1] if shift else char_pair[0])
            else:
                result.append(f'[UNKNOWN:{hex(keycode)}]')

    return ''.join(result)

output = decode_usb_file(usb.capdata)
print("Decoded Output:\n", output)
```
{% endfolding %}

running this script we got a HUGE plain text wall, and in that the flag was present !

![image](images/BtS-CTF-2025/see3.png)

format it a lil and voila~

`Flag: BtSCTF{m0nk3y_tYpE!!1!!oneone!}`


### Chiroptera Timida

> Shall pass this childish brainrot and get the flag!

> File: "Bat_Song.wav"

This is a quick one using audacity:

- Open file in audacity

- View in Spectrogram

- Zoom in and see the flag

![image](images/BtS-CTF-2025/chiro1.png)

`Flag: BtSCTF{I_am_batman_I_can_hear_it}`


### monkey paint?

> It seems like our monkey has got some new special abilities üêµ

> File: "monkey-paint.pcapng"

This is another USB data file, so I ran the same logic and got some different results... or more like nothing lmao

well, this the the difference was the capture data

![image](images/BtS-CTF-2025/paint1.png)

Took me a while to figure out, but again [usb HID](https://wiki.osdev.org/USB_Human_Interface_Devices) helped in figuring out that it's usb mouse capture data

A lil bit of google search and i came across this [USB mouse pcap visualizer](https://github.com/WangYihang/USB-Mouse-Pcap-Visualizer) i mean üíÄ the chall is joeover now

- git clone the repo

- setup the project

- run the cmd

```bash
poetry run python usb-mouse-pcap-visualizer.py -i monkey-paint.pcapng -o data.csv
```

- open run the csv in their website [mouse pcap visualizer](https://usb-mouse-pcap-visualizer.vercel.app/)

with a couple iterations to speed up the process I got these

![image](images/BtS-CTF-2025/paint2.png)

concatenate and u get the flag

`Flag: BtSCTF{yeah_it_does!11!}`

### copypasta

> I was moving one of the most relatable copypastas to me to a pendrive, but I think something went wrong during copying and pasting (hehe) and I can't open the file. To make matters worse, I forgot the password, but it should be one of those in a wordlist. Can you help me recover my favourite copypasta?

> Files: "copypasta.pdf" "wordlist.txt"

So we have a pdf file this time, firstly i cracked the password using `pdfcrack` and using the given wordlist

```bash
pdfcrack -w wordlist.txt copypasta.pdf
```

and i got the password `pumpkin`

I tried a lot of forensic methods but i couldn't figure out a way to get much info or fix it.

Cutting short from using `pdf-parser` and other many stuff, i found this website [pdf repair](https://www.freepdfconvert.com/repair-pdf) and it did the magic

### Sus data

> We caught the suspect, but his pendrive contained only this data. What could it be?

> File: "Sus_data"

This time i got a data file and found no info even after using file info cmds & tools.

I opened it in `hexeditor` and obviously found that the file format is wrong.

This was kinda similar chall too the [picoctf corrupt one](https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2019_picoCTF/c0rrupt.md)

so I fixed the file headers, u can see the before and after

![image](images/BtS-CTF-2025/sus1.png)

well, the file still wasn't fixed, i made use of `pngcheck` to understand more about it

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Downloads]
‚îî‚îÄ$ pngcheck -v Sus_data                  
zlib warning:  different version (expected 1.2.13, using 1.3.1)

File: Sus_data (321007 bytes)
  chunk IHDR at offset 0x0000c, length 13
    500 x 500 image, 24-bit RGB, non-interlaced
  chunk sRGB at offset 0x00025, length 1

  chunk gAMA at offset 0x00032, length 4: 0.45455

    zlib: deflated, 32K window, fast compression
    zlib: inflate error = -3 (data error)
ERRORS DETECTED in Sus_data
```

I knew it's a CRC error, but I just couldn't figure out a way to fix it... ggs ‚ö∞Ô∏è

I won't leave it a cliffhanger ofc- 

After the ctf ended, **Tamer (@yousef15865)** on discord posted the solve on how to solve the chall, and I got the privilege to add his answer here!

The issue was that the IEND chunk's CRC ended up inside the IDAT chunk by mistake. This made the IDAT chunk 4 bytes longer than it should‚Äôve been. Once we removed the misplaced IEND CRC from the IDAT chunk, the image should load correctly.

The script to fix it

```py
def remove_hex_pattern(file_path, hex_pattern):
    pattern_bytes = bytes.fromhex(hex_pattern)

    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        content = f.read()

    modified_content = content.replace(pattern_bytes, b'')

    with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(modified_content)

    print(f"Pattern {hex_pattern} removed from {file_path}")

remove_hex_pattern('Sus_data', 'AE426082')  
```

and voila, u can open the image!

and again a huge thanks to **Tamer (@yousef15865)** for helping in completing this one.
