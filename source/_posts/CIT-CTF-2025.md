Dropping it into cyberchef-

My dearest one, whose heart I hold,
In your eyes, I see a world untold.
Where logic and riddles dance like stars,
But you, my love, stand behind bars.

I know you don‚Äôt share in my joy,
The flags I chase, the games I deploy.
You sigh, you frown, and often retreat,
While I dive into challenges, so sweet.

But, oh, my love, can you see?
These puzzles are not just code to me.
They‚Äôre like whispers from a distant shore,
A challenge to unlock, a path to explore.

I dream of the day when you‚Äôll join the chase,
And feel the thrill of solving with grace.
Not because you have to, but because you‚Äôll find,
The joy in puzzles that ignites your mind.

I won‚Äôt push, I won‚Äôt rush,
No, I‚Äôll be gentle, soft as a hush.
But if you ever wish to see what I see,
I‚Äôll be here, waiting, with a flag for you and me.

Together, we can solve what‚Äôs unknown,
In the world of CTFs, you won‚Äôt be alone.
Let‚Äôs take it slow, no need to fear,
For love is the answer, my darling, my dear.

So, when you're ready, just take my hand,
Let‚Äôs solve the puzzle, make our stand.
And who knows, perhaps you‚Äôll see‚Äî
That even CTFs, too, can be love‚Äôs key.

Here I have an email file given, going through the file, u can kinda get the idea of another base64 string.

so trying it in cyberchef-

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/true-1.png)

Another quick flag !

Flag: `CIT{i_l0v3_ctf$_t00}`

### We lost the flag

> Sorry everyone, we unfortunately lost the flag for this challenge.

> File: "lost.png"

Here's a png file, and on opening it doesnt display anything.. mmm maybe try checking it

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/lost-1.png)

Not so helpful? well, its not even a png file,,, or is it? (vsauce moment)

I checked the File header real quick, and this found this

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/lost-2.png)

png is not this right?

Quick google search told me that its JFIF for .jpg files

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/lost-3.png)

Fixing the file header now, and now we can view the image !

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/lost-4.png)

Got the flag ! this was an cheeky but easy one too~

Flag: `CIT{us1ng_m4g1c_1t_s33m5}`

### Bits 'n Pieces 

> Somewhere in these digital fragments lies what you've been searching for your entire lifetime, or really just this weekend ;)

> File: "Cache0000.bin"

Firstly shoutout to my team Bits & Pieces, we got a chall named for us XD

So there's a bin file, `file` `exiftool` weren't really helpful, so with a bit of searching i found it's a Windows cache file and we can parse it using a github repo [bmc-tools](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/bmc-tools)

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/bits-1.png)

Parsing it we got 2992 files üíÄ oh boy we got alot to go through.

Using a little bit of iq, I can see that these are pieces of the windows page, it's like puzzle pieces of a screenshot.

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/bits-2.png)

I couldn't really go through them easily, so i searched for an effective way and found this github repo [RdpCacheStitcher](https://github.com/BSI-Bund/RdpCacheStitcher) This made it so much more easier to go through the pieces and connect them to make some sensible content.

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/bits-3.png)

Gotcha, This flag was tedious and took a WHILE, but got it

(also u can see in the image i got baited by a fake flag before the real one üò≠)

Flag: `CIT{c4ch3_m3_if_y0u_c4n}`

### Baller

> Find the flag.

> File: "baller.zip"

Alright so I have a zip file, and upon extracting we get 3 plain txt files (TLDR; they are useless)

So i spend doing some lil forensics on all the 3 files and go zero progress for like 20mins.

except for,,, `binwalk` yes ! binwalk showed something not in the plain txt files, BUT the .zip file

![image](images/CIT-CTF-2025/baller-1.png)

there's a .gif file hidden in the .zip which didn't show up upon extracting.

Binwalking the .zip file gave another zip file and on and on and on, infinite loop...

I need a more smarter approach. Focus on the decimal offset value of the file.

the gif file is AFTER the zip file offset ends. That makes sense why i was not able to extract it. More talks later, now let's try getting the gif file explicitly and for that we can use

```bash
dd if=baller.zip of=hidden.gif bs=1 skip=16631
```

dd command helps us extract the file when we specify the offset.

Upon opening the file

We got win win, a cute duck which brought the flag to us !

Flag: `CIT{im_balling_fr}`
